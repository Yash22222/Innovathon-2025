# Data Science Hackathon Problem Statements

| No. | Type                     | Problem Statement | Expected Outcome |
|----|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1  | **Prescriptive Analytics** | **Smart Public Transport Route Optimization** <br> Urban public transport faces inefficiencies due to static routes and schedules that don't adapt to changing commuter behavior. The challenge is to develop an AI-driven system that dynamically adjusts bus/train routes based on real-time passenger demand, traffic conditions, and external events. | - Integrate live GPS, traffic, and commuter data to optimize routes in real time. <br> - Use reinforcement learning to recommend route diversions to reduce congestion. <br> - Develop a simulation model that suggests changes in bus/train frequency based on historical and live demand trends. <br> - Provide actionable recommendations to transit authorities to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. |
| 2  | **Diagnostic Analytics** | **Root Cause Analysis for Supply Chain Disruptions in FMCG** <br> FMCG companies face frequent supply chain disruptions due to unforeseen demand fluctuations, supplier delays, logistics bottlenecks, and regional economic factors. Traditional methods focus on post-incident reporting rather than real-time root cause identification. Your challenge is to build an AI-driven diagnostic analytics system that dynamically identifies patterns leading to disruptions and pinpoints the root cause to help supply chain managers take proactive action. | - Analyze historical disruptions to detect recurring patterns in supply chain failures. <br> - Develop a multi-variable anomaly detection model that flags potential supply chain risks. <br> - Implement causal inference techniques to determine the true drivers of disruptions (e.g., weather impact, supplier performance, transport failures). <br> - Create a real-time interactive dashboard that alerts managers to emerging risks and recommends countermeasures before failures occur. <br> - Provide a self-learning system that refines its predictions based on newly incoming data. |
| 3  | **Predictive Analytics** | **Early Identification of Financial Fraud in Small Businesses** <br> Small businesses often suffer from financial fraud that remains undetected for months. The task is to predict potential fraudulent activities based on transaction data, expense patterns, and business anomalies before major financial damage occurs. | - Use historical financial transactions to identify irregular spending behaviors. <br> - Build a predictive model that flags businesses with a high risk of fraud. <br> - Integrate external market factors (such as sudden tax filings, supply chain issues) into the model. <br> - Provide an automated fraud alert system for small business owners. |
